simple budget created with React Native


Hi code eaters!

I will create a simple budget app with React Native and one of the main functionalities would be to:

- create an account
- sign in
- Add an income or budget for a time period.
- show potential savings
- Add expenses.
- Remove expenses.
- Save current details throught a RESTful API.

I will create my own RESTful API with Node.js and Express.js. The database will be MySQL which I will handle with Sequelize in Node.js.

I have uploaded the main screen image (simple-budget-main-page.png) after the sign in to have a better picture on how we will design the UI.
