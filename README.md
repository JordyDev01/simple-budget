simple budget created with React Native


Hi code eaters!

I will create a simple budget app with React Native and one of the main functionalities would be to:

- create an account
- sign in
- Add an income or budget for a time period.
- show potential savings
- Add expenses.
- Remove expenses.
- Save current details throught firebase real-time database 


I have uploaded the main screen image (simple-budget-main-page.png) after the sign in to have a better picture on how we will design the UI.
