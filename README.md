simple budget created with React Native


Hi code eaters!

I will create a simple budget app with React Native and one of the main functionalities would be to:

- Add an income or budget for a time period.
- show potential savings
- Add expenses.
- Remove expenses.
- Save current details throught a RESTful API.

I will create my own backend as well with Node.js and Express.js.
